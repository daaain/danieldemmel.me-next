				on colour schemes, decoration and buying furniture and art for their homes. Daniel is a qualified
				engineer who has been working in the construction industry in the UK and Spain for the last four years.
				Working together, they co-ordinate different projects elements and sub-contractors to ensure that
				projects run to agreed time-scales. They have an eye for detail and are always concerned to achieve the
				highest level of finish.</p><br />
