summary: The first iteration of a product should be about learning

I gave a talk about building and iterating an MVP at the brilliant Workplace Hackshop organised by HackHumanity.

It's a short presentation so take a look, but these are the just the main points for the busiest executives:

- Form key hypotheses – optimise for learning, not functionality
- Express your main value proposition
- Get it out – if you’re not ashamed of it, you wasted time
- Measure every user interaction
- Know where your audience hangs out
- Look for customers ready to pay
- Fake it, kludge it, hack it together
