summary: How Lisbon have changed in 30 years
---

This year we visited Lisbon, partially inspired by the pictures from Wim Wenders's Lisbon Story.

Amazingly, it's been filmed pretty much exactly 30 years before our visit, so like any normal film nerd, we decided to take some screenshots of the film, save them on the phone, and try to identify them as we walk around and explore the city.

This endeavour was helped a lot by finding [a walking trail someone shared](https://www.wikiloc.com/wikiloc/view.do?pic=walking-trails&slug=lisbon-story-center-wim-wenders-and-alain-tanner-film-locations-alfama-palacio-belmonte-castelo-mou&id=103001245&rd=en).

It was impossible to properly recreate the shots with our phone cameras, not only because of the film grain, but very different (I think longer) lens and possibly yellow filter. Also, the time of the day was often quite different too and maybe even the season. So we didn't try to overdo it to perfection, but I think it's still fun to see them as diptychs and I tried to line up at least one element in each pair.
