## Why you should stop installing development environments locally

This is the talk I gave about containers / Docker at the [re:develop conference](https://redevelop.io) in 2015 in Bournemouth.

In the years since, working with Docker got much simpler, if you install and download [Docker for Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) you're pretty much set without having to muck about with Docker Machine and VMs.

### Code

Make sure to also have a look at the [companion repository on Github](https://github.com/ustwo/docker-node-boilerplate), which shows how to set up a Node based development environment with Docker. Of course it would work with anything else which runs on Linux, but this simple working example should give you a good starting point.
