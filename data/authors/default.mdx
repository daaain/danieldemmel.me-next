# Hey, I'm dain

a design technologist and full-stack AI engineer at [Tangible](https://www.tangible.finance/).

I got my first computer (a basic 386 PC) in the early 1990s, after years of bothering my cousins if I can use their Commodore 64. I started tinkering with my computer right away (motivated by a mix of curiosity and the need to tweak `config.sys` and `himem.sys` to get video games to run in DOS with limited hardware) and did my first programming experiment building an interactive periodic table in Borland C++ sometime around 1996.

At the end of the 1990s I got into web design and development by creating websites for small businesses using Macromedia Flash for a bit of extra pocket money. My first proper software development job was through my university internship at a digital advertising agency called Carnation (now part of Wunderman Thompson Budapest) in 2005.

I've been living in London, UK since 2007 (with shorter periods in Malm√∂, Sweden and Amsterdam, Netherlands) where I worked at [ustwo](https://ustwo.com/) from 2007 and [Beryl Bikes](https://beryl.cc/) from 2018, before joining Tangible in 2024.

I'm a husband, dad of 2, neurodivergent and interested in AI, metacognition, rationalism, epistemology, open source, degrowth, spiritual ecology, activism, minimalism, amongst others.
