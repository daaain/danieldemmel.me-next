Hey, I'm Daniel, a design technologist and full-stack developer at [Twist](https://www.twist.eco/).

I got my first computer (a basic 386 PC) in the early 1990s, after years of bothering my cousins if I can use their Commodore 64. I started tinkering with my computer right away (motivated by a mix of curiosity and the need to tweak `config.sys` and `himem.sys` to get video games to run in DOS with limited hardware) and did my first programming experiment building an interactive periodic table in Borland C++ sometime around 1996.

At the end of the 1990s I got into web design and development by creating websites for small businesses using Macromedia Flash for a bit of extra pocket money. My first proper software development job was through my university internship at a digital advertising agency called Carnation (now part of Wunderman Thompson Budapest) in 2005.

I've been living in London, UK since 2007 (with shorter periods in Malmö, Sweden and Amsterdam, Netherlands) where I worked at [ustwo](https://ustwo.com/) from 2007 and [Beryl Bikes](https://beryl.cc/) from 2018, before joining Twist in 2024.

I ♥ open source and I'm a degrowth & spiritual ecology activist, minimalist, flexitarian, husband, dad of 2, neurodivergent.
